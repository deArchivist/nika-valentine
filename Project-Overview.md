I need to create an interactive Valentine's experience that combines a functional Sudoku puzzle with animated flowers. The project should follow this specific sequence:

Primary color: #ffd1dd pink
Secondary Color: white
Tetiary color: #93c082 green

1. SUDOKU PUZZLE SECTION
Technical Requirements:
- Functional 9x9 Sudoku grid with pre-filled numbers
- Custom heart-shaped cursor with particle trail effects
- Background music system with fade in/out capabilities
- Grid Layout:
  * Pre-filled numbers
  * Validation for correct number inputs (1-9 only)
  * Cell highlighting on input
  * 3x3 section borders


Visual Effects:
- Glowing "LET'S GO" button with pulsing animation
- Heart-shaped cursor that follows mouse movement
- Particle trail effects behind cursor
- Cell hover animations
- Custom font: 'Mali' from Google Fonts

2. TRANSITION SEQUENCE
When puzzle is completed:
- Sudoku board explodes into particles
- Floating hearts animation
- Screen fades to night sky
- The sudoku board particles turns into stars
- Stars twinkles
- Full moon rises with glow effect
- Valentine's question fades in

3. VALENTINE'S QUESTION SECTION
Elements:
- Text: "Will you continue to be my valentine indefinitely? üíù"
- Two interactive buttons:
  * "Yes" button (pink/red gradient, grows on "No" click)
  * "No" button (gray, shrinks on click)
- Background: Dark night sky with twinkling stars
- Glowing full moon in top-right corner

4. FLOWER ANIMATION SECTION
I have existing flower animation files (html,css,js all written down in #flower.md file)with:
- Three main flowers blooming in sequence
- Color scheme:
  * First flower: Orange gradient (#ff4d00 to #ff8533)
  * Second flower: Yellow gradient (#ffcc00 to #ffeb99)
  * Third flower: Red gradient (#ff0000 to #ff4d4d)
- Additional elements:
  * Growing grass animations
  * Swaying leaves
  * Twinkling light effects
  * Complex CSS animations

5. AUDIO REQUIREMENTS
- Background music changes for each section
- Smooth transitions between tracks
- Toggle button in top-right corner
- Volume fade in/out effects

6. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
CSS Requirements:
- Custom animations for all transitions
- GSAP for complex animations
- Particle system for effects
- Z-index management for proper layering
- Responsive design considerations

JavaScript Features:
- Sudoku game logic
- Event handling for all interactions
- Audio controller class
- Particle system class
- Animation sequence management

Here's some QnA
1. Sudoku Puzzle Section
Should the Sudoku puzzle be randomly generated or fixed with a specific pattern?
Do you want the Sudoku grid to be interactive (e.g., users can input numbers directly)?
Should the Sudoku puzzle include a "Hint" or "Solve" button for assistance?
Do you want the "LET'S GO" button to trigger the Sudoku puzzle or another action?
2. Transition Sequence
How long should the transition sequence last (e.g., 3 seconds, 5 seconds)?
Should the Sudoku board particles have a specific color or follow the primary/secondary color scheme?
Should the floating hearts animation be random or follow a specific pattern?
Should the full moon rise from a specific direction (e.g., bottom-left, top-right)?
3. Valentine's Question Section
Should the "Yes" button trigger a specific animation or transition (e.g., more flowers blooming)?
Should the "No" button have a maximum number of clicks before it disappears or stops shrinking?
Should the Valentine's question text have any special effects (e.g., fade-in, typewriter effect)?
4. Flower Animation Section
Should the flower animations start automatically or be triggered by user interaction?
Should the flower animations loop or play only once?
Should the grass animations be continuous or triggered by specific events?
5. Audio Requirements
Do you have specific background music tracks in mind, or should I suggest some?
Should the audio toggle button include a volume slider or just a mute/unmute option?
Should the background music loop or play once per section?
6. Technical Specifications
Should the project be built as a single-page application (SPA) or multiple pages?
Do you have a preferred JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue) or should it be vanilla JS?
Should the project include any accessibility features (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)?
Do you have a specific deadline for this project?

1, Should be fixed with a pattern
- ofc input numbers directly
- no need for hint
- once the puzzle has been filled in, the button triggers the transition to the transtion sequence

2, the particle should be white since stars are white, we want the particles to turn into stars too
- floating hearts random, but the heart emoji and rises from the bottom
- the room fades in

3, the yes button triggers the flower animation section
just keep shrinking it
typewritier effect is good

4, triggered by the yes button above
the flower has a start animation after that it goes to idling
there's no grass animations, no need to create new animations just use the one i provided you and implement it correctly

5, unmute and mmute
play once per section and i will provide the songs in a folder

6, im new to web dev so recommend me the easiest simple and free way to do it, and between spa and multiple which one is better for our project such as this?

additional questions to clarify before proceeding with implementation:

Cursor and Particles:
The current cursor.js has basic particle effects, but should we modify the particles to be heart-shaped instead of the default circular shape?
Would you like the cursor itself to be a filled heart or just an outline?
What color scheme should the particles follow - should they fade from the primary pink (#ffd1dd) to white?
Animation Sequencing:
The transition.js shows floating hearts, but should we integrate GSAP for smoother animations?
For the sudoku board particle explosion, how many particles per cell would you prefer? This affects performance.
Should the moon rise animation include a subtle wobble effect or keep it strictly vertical?
Flower Integration:
The flower.md file shows complex CSS animations. Should we convert any of these to GSAP for better performance?
For the blooming sequence timing (75% triggers), should we use precise timing or visual cues?
Do you want to keep the existing flower colors exactly as shown in flower.md or adjust to match your specified gradients?
Performance Considerations:
What's the minimum browser compatibility you need to support?
Should we implement lazy loading for the flower animations since they appear later?
Would you like to include any loading indicators between sections?
Project Structure:
For a new web developer, I'd recommend a Single Page Application (SPA) without a framework (vanilla JS) for this project. Does this align with your preference?
Would you like the code organized by features (sudoku, flowers, transitions) or by type (CSS, JS, HTML)?
Should we implement a build process (like Vite) or keep it simple with direct files?

1, yes, filled heart, the trail should be pink

2, yes, keep it the same, vertical is fine

3, no need as to not affect the files too much, precise timing maybe, match it to my preffered color and gradients for the flower

4, no need

5, do whats best for this, and do your thing you have all the permissions
